      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Our web application allows users to authenticate their documents by entering a secret key provided by the issuing authority. The system verifies the document's validity without revealing any personal information to third parties. Once authenticated, users can generate a QR code for easy verification by authorized parties.</p>
